# whats_in_the_fridge
collection of recipes and stories for Sue's cookbook or cooking blog

This project will involve these tasks:
- collection of recipes, identifying ideas to develop and creation of new recipes
- categorization of recipes
- writing descriptions/stories to tie the recipes to the theme of the book (improvising with available ingredients)
- writing introductory chapter
- creating a resources chapter
- photographing the food

currently the book will be written by me (Sue Tinney) with support and input from my mom and husband; other collaborators may be identified as time passes.
